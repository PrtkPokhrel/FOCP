# TASK: Input code containing a for loop that iterates over a list of numbers, printing a
# running total during each iteration. You may wish to first define the numbers list as follows:
# >>> numbers = [10, 20 , 30, 90, 200, 30, 22, 11]

numbers = [10,36, 200, 30, 22, 11,2,244,12]
for i in numbers:
    print(i)
