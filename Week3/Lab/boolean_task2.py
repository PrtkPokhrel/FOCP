# TASK: Input a program that defines a variable called ‘age’ that is initialised to your own age.
# Then type several boolean expressions that compare the variable to see whether it is less
# than ‘18’, ‘21’ then ‘31’.

my_age=19
age1=18
age2=21
age3=31

# Comparing:
print('Age is lss than 18: ',my_age<age1)
print('Age is less than 21: ',my_age<age2)
print('Age is less than 31: ',my_age<age3)

# Output:
"""
Age is lss than 18:  False
Age is less than 21:  True
Age is less than 31:  True
"""
