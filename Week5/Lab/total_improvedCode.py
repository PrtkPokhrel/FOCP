# TASK: Improve the previous program by adding additional code that not only prints the total
# of any passed arguments, but also calculates and prints the average. Execute the program
# several times for testing. What happens if no arguments are passed?

    print("Total is: ", total)
    print("Average is: ", average)
else:
    print("No arguments provided")
