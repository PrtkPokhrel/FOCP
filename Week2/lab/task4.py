# Try extending the code below so that it creates a new variable called ‘average’, that
# is set to equal the average calculated from the two other variables.


total = 98.2
count = 5


average = total / count

print("Total:", total)
print("Count:", count)
print("Average:", average)

# Output
# Total: 98.2
# Count: 5
# Average: 19.64
