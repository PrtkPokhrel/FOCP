# TASK: The built-in print() function supports a keyword argument called sep. This is used
# to decide what character to display between each of the provided positional parameters.
# Write some code that makes several calls to the print() function while setting the sep
# argument to values other than a space (which is the default).

print("Hello", "World", sep='-')  
print("One", "Two", "Three", sep='* ')  
print(1, 2, 3, sep='+')
